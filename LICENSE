## Pro Tips:

- **Use descriptive folder names** (not too long)
- **Keep it organized** - group related files together
- **Add `.gitkeep` files** in empty folders to preserve them
- **Use consistent naming** (camelCase or snake_case)
- **Include a good README** - it's the first thing people see!

That's it! Your UI library will be nicely organized on GitHub.
